I was very pleased to work together recently with XYZ agency to create a new blazing fast React Image component designed and built to work seamlessly with Gatsby's native image processing capability.

This is something I've hoped to build for a long time and am really pleased that it exists, etc.

I still remember the first non-trivial React component I built fairly soon after I started using React seriously in 2014.

I was building a web app and wanted a sticky headroom like you could create using headroom.js.

Steps to use headroom.js

```jsx
<Headroom>This is all you have to do</Headroom>
```

Which just felt insane how much simpler it is. So simple. Install the NPM package, import it, and write a bit of JSX.

Power of code is ability to create new building blocks. Problem with web is stuck with same low-level building blocks, div, span, headers, img, etc.

Imagine programming without the ability to create functions? That's a fair analogy to what building for the web was like before React. Every project involved a lot of copy & pasting and "bookkeeping" to make sure everything was in the right place and hooked up right. Debugging meant checking a 1/2 dozen spots to try to see where something broke (and things were *always* breaking). You had to build up an intricate map in your head of how different technologies interacting with each other to make even trivial changes to a site or app.

React performed a magic disappearing act on frontend complexity. `headroom.js`, css, html, all dissapeared into `<Headroom />`.

Frequently frontend performance articles and talks give off a wiff of machoism. "If you only work hard and long enough, you too, with sufficient effort, can build a fast site".

Does that strike people as odd? That I have to work hard to make things fast? Why can't I just build what I want and it's still fast?

I really enjoy cooking. Purusing recipe books, heading to my favorite hipster grocery stores, chopping, crafting, etc. I enjoy the colors, the smells, flavors. It's perhaps the closest thing to art I regularly do.

But programming isn't (generally) art. Or if it is, it's more akin to industrial art like what Apple does. High quality manufactured goods produced at enormous scale and quality.

It strikes me as incredibly strange that building something so it's fast is *hard*. Why are websites slow by default and only fast if you're some sort of performance wizard?

Why can amateurs create iOS and Android apps that load quickly and have fluid animations and screen transitions?

I've spent my entire career building for the web and the current state of things really bothers me.

Build new primatives that are fast and easy to use by default. Build on top of React so it's super easy to 

Every one can build incredibly fast websites — as long as they're willing to put in the research and work. The goal of Gatsby is to not just make it possible building incredible fast websites but make it the default, the easy option. 



websites not fast by default. HOW ANNOYING! What is React? functions for web. Headroom / gatsby-image & integrated data transformation. Makes it trivial to create new seamless abstractions that have performance baked in.

people thought compiliers were crazy, my hand-tuned assembly kicks the pants off your C!

People say the same thing about building with JavaScript frameworks. That hand-crafted vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS will always be faster than using a "framework".

Gatsby's claim is that a React website, built with highly performant React component building blocks and compiled by Gatsby, is faster than all but the most tightly tuned hand-crafted websites and at a *tiny* fraction of the effort.

Vanilla web technology is for nostalgic hipsters. Professionals use power tools.

Please build your next website with Gatsby and start enjoying consistent, scalable high performance.
